## What's New?

* Reverted zluda version back to 3.8.4. After updating try running patchzluda and if still have problems, delete venv and re-run install.bat.

* Added a "small flux guide." This aims to use low vram and provides the very basic necessary files needed to get flux generation running. [HERE](fluxguide.md)
* Added --reserve-vram with the value of 0.9 to commandline options that run with the app on startup. Greatly helps reduce using too much memory on generations.
* Changed `start.bat` to `comfyui.bat` because there is already a windows command by that name, which
  creates some problems. Also added  `fix-update.bat` which solves the problem that causes not being able to
  update to the latest version.
* Updated ZLUDA to 3.8.4, thanks to lshqqytiger for still supporting HIP SDK 5.7.1. Install will install that version from
  now on, and if you are already on the previous one please run `patchzluda.bat` once. Of course, remember the
  first time for every type of model would take extra time. You can still use both zluda's on the same machine btw. But
  I recommend updating.

## Dependencies

If coming from the very start, you need :

1. **Git**: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win.
   During installation don't forget to check the box for "Use Git from the Windows Command line and also from
   3rd-party-software" to add Git to your system's PATH.
2. **Python** (3.10.11 or 3.11 from the official website): Install the latest release from python.org. **Don't Use
   Windows Store Version**. If you have that installed, uninstall and please install from python.org. During
   installation remember to check the box for "Add Python to PATH when you are at the "Customize Python" screen.
3. **Visual C++ Runtime**: Download [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and install it.
4. Install **HIP SDK 5.7.1** from [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html)
    - **Update**: HIP 6.1.x is available but as of 01.2025 there are no speed improvements of it over using 5.7.1 as far as I know , please be careful about
      selecting the correct version, "Windows 10 & 11 5.7.1 HIP SDK"
5. Add the system variable HIP_PATH, value: `C:\\Program Files\\AMD\\ROCm\\5.7\\` (This is the default folder, if you
   have installed it on another drive, change if necessary)
    1. Check the variables on the lower part (System Variables), there should be a variable called: HIP_PATH.
    2. Also check the variables on the lower part (System Variables), there should be a variable called: "Path".
       Double-click it and click "New" add this: `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin`
6. If you have an AMD GPU below 6800 (6700,6600 etc.), download the recommended library files for your gpu
   from [Brknsoul Repository](https://github.com/brknsoul/ROCmLibs)
    1. Go to folder "C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin\rocblas", there would be a "library" folder, backup the files
       inside to somewhere else.
    2. Open your downloaded optimized library archive and put them inside the library folder (overwriting if
       necessary): "C:\\Program Files\\AMD\\ROCm\\5.7\\bin\\rocblas\\library"
7. Reboot your system.

## Setup (Windows-Only)

Open a cmd prompt. (Powershell doesn't work, you have to use command prompt.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patientx/ComfyUI-Zluda
```

```bash
cd ComfyUI-Zluda
```

```bash
install.bat
```

to start for later use (or create a shortcut to) :

```bash
comfyui.bat
```

also for later when you need to repatch zluda (maybe a torch update etc.) you can use:

```bash
patchzluda.bat
```

- The first generation would take around 10-15 minutes, there won't be any progress or indicator on the webui or cmd
  window, just wait. Zluda creates a database for use with generation with your gpu.

> [!NOTE]
> **This might happen with torch changes , zluda version changes and / or gpu driver changes.**

## Troubleshooting

- Wipe your pip cache "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\pip\cache" You can also do this when venv is active with :
  `pip cache purge`
- `xformers` isn't usable with zluda so any nodes / packages that require it doesn't work. `Flash attention`
  doesn't work. And lastly using `codeformer` for face restoration gives "Failed inference: CUDA driver error:
  unknown error" You should use gfpgan / gpen / restoreformer or other face restoration models.
- Have the latest drivers installed for your amd gpu. **Also, Remove Any Nvidia Drivers** you might have from previous
  nvidia
  gpu's.
- If you see zluda errors make sure these three files are inside "ComfyUI-Zluda\venv\Lib\site-packages\torch\lib\"
  `cublas64_11.dll (231kb)` `cusparse64_11.dll (199kb)` `nvrtc64_112_0.dll (129kb)` If they are there but much bigger in size please run : `patchzluda.bat`
- If for some reason you can't solve with these and want to start from zero, delete "venv" folder and re-run
  `install.bat`
- If you can't git pull to the latest version, run these commands, `git fetch --all` and then
  `git reset --hard origin/master` now you can git pull
- Problems with `caffe2_nvrtc.dll`: if you are sure you properly installed hip and can see it on path, please DON'T use
  python from windows store, use the link provided or 3.11 from the official website. After uninstalling python from
  windows store and installing the one from the website, be sure the delete venv folder, and run install.bat once again.
- `rocBLAS`-error: If you have an integrated GPU by AMD (e.g. AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics) you need to add `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1` to your
  environment variables. Otherwise it will default to using your iGPU, which will most likely not work. This behavior is caused by a bug in the ROCm-driver.
